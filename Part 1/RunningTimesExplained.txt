The running times are variable because threads by nature are semi-random. Depending on how the CPU resources are allocated in real time, the buffer might end up being full or empty more often, leading to more yields of the CPU and thus an increased running time. Additionally, if this were to be tested on different computers with different CPUs the running time could change even more depending on how powerful the CPU running the program is. If a CPU takes longer to finish processing transactions in order to empty the InBuffer, it might fill up faster and lead to more yields overall, which could significantly increase the running time of the program.
